# Homework One - Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Wise, formerly TransferWise

* Wise was incorporated in January 2011 as Transferwise. The name was formally changed to Wise in February 2021. 

* Wise was founded by two Estonians, Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Kaarmann. Mr. Hinrikus was the first employee of Skype who met Mr. Kaarmann in Skype's initial funding days. 

* The idea originated as a function of lowering fees from payment transfers from Mssrs. Hinrikus and Kaarmann's native Estonian to London where most of their respective business was being conducted. This is evidenced by site Monito's research stating currency transactions were on average 83% less than the respective fee from one of Britain's Big 4 Banks. 

* in 2011, Wise raised an initial seed funding of $1.3 million spread accross multiple venture firms such as IA Ventures, Index Ventures, IJNR Ventures and NYPPE. The proof of concept also caught the attention individual insvestors such as PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, and British sports betting book Betfair's CEO David Yu

B Round funding occured in May 2013 to the tune of a $6m round led by Peter Thiel. B round 2.0 occured in June 2014 with a $25m equity funding by Sir Richard Branson. 

C Round occured in January 2015 with the announcement of $58m led by private investor Andreeson Horowitz. May 2016's round of funding resulted in an infusion of $26m to raise the company's valuation to $1.1B. At the point of this valuation, Wise raised a total of $117m in funding. 

Series E occured in November 2017 with an addition of $280m. this round of funding was syndicated and led by Old Mutual Global Investors. The second round of Series E funding occured in May 2019 for $292m reaching a total valuation of $3.5B. 


## Business Activities:

* Wise's mission is to reduce the cost of transfering capital accross borders. Wise's founders Mssrs. Hinrikus and Kaarmann believe globalism will not slow down thus capital should be accessible and as readily available as people's movements are. 

* Wise's intended customer is any continental european looking to transfer euro/pound to the UK post Brexit, as well as worldwide customers looking to transfer currency abroad. Wise will service global customers however the idea origianted with a focus on lowering transactional costs of moving currency from mainland Europe to the UK. 

* Wise leverages Peer to Peer transfering systems. This is different than traditional international transfers as funds are not actually crossing borders. Wise's Peer to Peer network pairs users who are transfering from like country to like country and swapping their funds. For this technology to work, a sophisticated ledger system must exist in order to successfully compete "transfers". Furthermore, Wise uses the mid-makert rate and doesn't actually accept a fee when converting currency. The foregoing of an exchange rate fee is the competitive advantage Wise has created for themselves. 


## Landscape:

* Wise exists in the consumer international banking segment of financial services. 

* Major trends within this segment over the last 5 years includes the shrinking of margins. Fees have reduced while companies offer more services for less cost to the consumer. This reduction in cost has been the result of firms like Wise who are figuring out ways to reduce overall costs to consumers. 

* PayPal is Wise's direct competitor within the international consumer banking segment. However, Wise can offer up to 6% more in total amount transfered as they are not charging the same currency exchange fee which their main competitor PayPal is. 


## Results

* Wise is directly responsible for shrinking margins for the UK's High Street banking system. The UK's big banks biggest portion of revenue comes from sending money to continental Europe, therefore when Wise is offering spreads that cannot be beat by High Street banks, Wise quickly scloses the gap in marketshare. 

* Wise leverages core metrics such as Pounds/Month sent and Euro/Month converted. 

* Wise is quickly gathering marketshare while PayPal is shrinking in the european space. 


## Recommendations

* If I was a strategic consultant to Wise I would offer customers Certificates of Deposit for the strategic purpose of gatheric "Sticky Money". Currently Wise has funds coming in and out, however, if the firm wants to grow their position from a service provider to full service financial institution, they would be wise to focus on growing deposits. 

* I believe and posit it would be wise for Wise to offer long term savings products such as CDs or Money Market accounts because currently their users are 'cash in - cash out". If Wise can bridge the gap to become an institution that offers more services beyond treasury mangement and transfer services, they will be able to attract more customers. 

* Wise would need to leverage a relationship with a nonhostile bank that would purchase their deposits. Wise would create a spread betweeen what the purchasing bank would be willing to pay vs what they're willing to offer their customers. 

* This is appropriate because it allows Wise to gather marketshare away from High Street banks that currently offer these products. If Wise can offer the same product as High Street banks, plus cheaper continental Europe transfers, they will gain marketshare.
